    You wake up to the sun peeking through the blinds, a white glow illuminating your room. It's 11:36am and you feel well rested. You start your daily routine of checking your phone. But, when you check your phone, you see the following message: "SOS: ZOMBIE OUTBREAK. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY."
</h2>
<h2>
You can hardly believe this news is real. Reluctantly, you unlock your phone and shakily click on the News App icon. The entire phone screen is flooded with news articles about a zombie outbreak on the east coast, United States... where you live.
</h2>

<h2>
    Anxiety sets in and your heart feels like it's beating out of your chest. You think about your family and want to check on them before your (almost) certain demise.
