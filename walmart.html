<h2>You head out to your car, a black Honda Civic. The streets are eerily silent. Silence, on the other hand, is much better than the other possibilities.</h2>
<h2>
    You get into your car and start the drive towards Walmart. It only takes you about 10 minutes to make it there. Cars littered the parking lot and along the streets nearby. It seems that everyone decided they needed to go to Walmart for supplies. Before you could back out of the parking lot and leave, a little zombie boy pulled open your car door. You didn't make it out.
