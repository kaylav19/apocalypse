<h2>You decided you should avoid big crowds of people and found a small farm nearby. Risser Farm. You run out to your car, a black Honda Civic, and get inside. To be extra safe you lock the doors. The streets seem eerily silent, but it was better than the other possibilities.</h2>
<h2>
    You hit the gas pedal and make the short drive out of town and to Risser Farm. Risser Farm always had a little market open for fresh produce, but a "CLOSED" sign was taped on the front door. You get out of your car anyway and walk to the front door. You knock a few times, and a little old man hobbles to the door. You explain to him that you are looking for just a little food to take with you on the road. Without so much as a nod, the old man retreats to another room in the market. A few minutes later he's on his way back, unlocks the front door, and hands you a cardboard box full of fresh produce and some jars of jams. You also notice a half of a loaf of white bread nestled in the corner of the box.
</h2>

<h2>
    "Thank you so, so much sir." you say to the little old man. With a tight smile he bids you good luck and disappears back into his market again. It might not be much but at least it was a start.
</h2>
