<h2>
    With shaky hands you dial your parent's home phone number, but you receive nothing but static. There must be something wrong with the phones right now.
</h2>

<h2>
    You decide you will just make the drive there. After all, it only takes about 15 minutes to get to your parent's house. You rush out the door and to your car, a black Honda Civic, and you notice the street is eerily silent. You suppose the silence is better than the other possibilities. You hop into the car and start driving.
</h2>

<h2>
    When you make it to your parent's house you notice your mom's car door is open. Slowly, you get out of the car and make your way towards your mom's car. Either she forgot to close the door or there was something seriously wrong. You gently shut your mom's car door and make your way to the front door of your parent's house. You knock a few times. No answer.
</h2>

<h2>
    After 30 seconds of waiting you decide to turn the door knob, and it opens. The door was unlocked. Taking a few steps inside, you notice most of the lights are still on. All of the lights, except the lamp in the living room was on. At a closer glance, you notice the lamp isn't on because it was broken and wet blood seeped along the lampshade.
</h2>

<h2>
    A split second was all it took and a zombified mother burst her way out from behind the corner, flesh dripping from her teeth. You didn't make it out.
